# Blackjack Game

Blackjack, otherwise known as Twenty-One, Vingt-et-Un, or Pontoon, is a classic card game, approximately 250 years old. I have written this code for a tech assessment for the BBC Software Engineering graduate scheme. 

I have used ReactJS to build a small app to simulate a hand of blackjack.

I have also written unit tests to prove that may code works. **add link to tests here**

The goal of the game is to get a hand of cards that’s worth as close to 21 points as possible. If a player’s hand goes over 21 points, they have lost. 

The player is initially dealt two cards. They may then choose to ‘hit’ (draw a card) or ‘stand’ (stop drawing cards.) If they ‘hit’, then the new card’s value is added to the hand total. If this total exceeds 21, the player is ‘bust’, and loses.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
